# Browser Wars

---

# So what browser wars?

 - ### Unit tests for a front end application that run only in node on the command line aren't a complete picture.
 - ### Each browser has its own JS runtime. _Bocoup helps browser vendors test these for spec compliance._
 - ### Visually we know each browser treats CSS and HTML slightly different. _Bocoup also helps browser vendors test these implementations._

# Installing lots of browsers locally

 - ### This can probably only get you visibility into a single release of a browser, and maybe one version up or down from current.
 - ### Modern.ie, VMWare, and VirtualBox are great but VMs use our finite computing resources!
